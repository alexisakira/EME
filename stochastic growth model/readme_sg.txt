Solving stochastic growth model numerically
Written by Alexis Akira Toda
Confirmed to run on Matlab R2023b

**Explanation of files**

- expGrid.m		construct exponential grid
- get_cv.m		update consumption and value functions using Bellman equation
- get_cv_obj.m		objective function for updating consumption and value functions
- main_sg.m		main file for displaying results of stochastic growth model
- solve_sg.m		numerically solve stochastic growth model

**Replicating results**

1. Run "main_sg.m"
